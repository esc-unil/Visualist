    Choropleth maps represent a quantity (number of events, percentages, etc.) by color (or pattern)
    for administrative areas. They allow values to be compared by region and demographic information to be used
    to weight measurements.

    The grid map divides the area into squares and represents the number of events within each cell.
    The operation is quite simple. The program creates a layer of polygons (squares) whose size can be configured.
    Then the number of events in each square is counted.
    The choice of the grid size can be guided by the average distance expected if the points were randomly distributed.

    Graduated line maps represent the number of events along roads (polyline layer).
    Events are projected onto the segments closest to their positions,
    but only if the distance between them is less than a configurable threshold (e. g. 50 meters)

    Graduated Segmented line maps represent the number of events along roads (polyline layer).
    The algorithm starts by dividing the roads into segments whose length can be configured.
    The segment closest to each point is then identified. Events are projected onto the
    segments closest to their positions, but only if the distance between them is less than
    a configurable threshold (e. g. 50 meters).

    The map shows the hotspots identified by the analysis of the closest neighbours.
    This algorithm is a simplified version of Ned Levineâ€™s algorithm in CrimeStat.

  description:  >
    Proportional symbol maps group all points with the same position together at a single point.
    A circle whose size is proportional to the number of events is then created.

    The points can also be grouped with a polygon layer to represent all events within each area as a single aggregate.
